### Background（Current Problems）
  In the first place, there are mainly three problems present in the comic industry caused by pirate websites especially in Japan. 
  Firstly, no royalties are paid to comic creators, even though many people enjoy their comics on the internet. 
  Secondly, the spiral of cat-and-mouse game of prohibitions, which means even if the government or the police shut down one illegal website, the another one will emerge in a while. This will continues as long as the internet exists.
  Thirdly, not only comic industry but also the other publishing industry are spending a lot of money to set a countermeasure against pirating. 
  As a result of these problems, according to Japan Times, “Damage done by pirated comics to the domestic manga market may have reached ¥50 billion and the damage in the U.S. was even more severe: An estimated ¥1.3 trillion may have been lost to piracy.”
  Therefore, pirate comic websites certainly have a massive negative influence on comic industry.
